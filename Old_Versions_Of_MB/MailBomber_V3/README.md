# V.3 IS OUT, BIGGEST UPDATE YET

- A second version has been added within the program. The second one is more optimised to use with larger amounts of mail. Both versions are currently active. If you want to access the better, faster version go into info when running the program. If you want use the normal version (might be more stable, but is less productive when handling with larger amounts of mails) just use it as normal when calling the program.
- Fixed bunch of bugs
- Made the UI much prettier
- Made the program overall faster without losing stability
